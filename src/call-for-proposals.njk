      <p>
        Sharing knowledge with the community shouldn’t be a privilege of those who can afford it. We know that planning a good talk takes a lot of time and love. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve worked hard to start compensating speakers for some of your time this year. Things we can compensate each confirmed speaker: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          $500 (GST exclusive) speaking fee per delivered talk
        </li>
        <li>
          Up to $200 (GST inclusive) of pre-approved domestic travel expenses
        </li>
        <li>
          A free ticket to EVENT_NAME 2025
        </li>
        <li>
          Full resolution photographs of you delivering your talk
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="section-title">Why in-person talks only?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text-indent">
      <p>
        Due to our limited resources, we’re unable to facilitate live remote presentations (speaking or attending). We’re asking all speakers to speak in-person this year.  
      </p>
      <p>
        We do hope to be able to offer more flexibility in the future.
