  <p>
    EVENT_NAME wants to see the NZ software engineering community be inspired by how other local companies and engineers are thriving. We are keen to hear Kiwis share how they address different engineering concerns in the NZ context and feel empowered to try those solutions out at their organisations. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Attendees will learn from these experiences and get practical advice from other Kiwis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's rally the NZ software industry together to become more resilient for 2025 and beyond.
