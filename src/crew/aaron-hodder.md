<p>Aaron cares about great people building great software responsibly. Therefore, he focuses on the human aspects of software development; both in terms of the humans who use and are affected by our products, and the humans who create them.</p>

<p>Community is very important to Aaron. He co-founded WeTest workshops in Wellington, founded the Human Impact in Tech unconference, and is now a director of NZ Tech Rally.</p>

<p>Aaron speaks on many topics in the digital engineering space, including <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPkM6dsvFYY&t=1s&pp=ygURY2FteSBhYXJvbiBob2RkZXI%3D' rel='external'>retaining engineering talent</a>, the value of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlgvFwx9JF8&t=1s&pp=ygUMYWFyb24gaG9kZGVy' rel='external'>non-technical testing</a>, and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOzwZgI1o7g&t=951s&pp=ygUMYWFyb24gaG9kZGVy' rel='external'>neurodiversity in tech</a>.</p>

<p>His latest professional interests are in the human and societal impacts of technology and how teams can be more conscious of the ways their products may inadvertently cause harm and distress.</p>
