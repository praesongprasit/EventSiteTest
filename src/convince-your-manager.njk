          Dear [Manager/Approver],
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to request for approval and financial assistance to attend <a href="{{ site.url }}">EVENT_NAME 2025</a> in-person.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Date</strong>: Friday, 16<sup>th</sup> May 2025<br>
          <strong>Time</strong>: 8:00am to 5:00pm<br>
          <strong>Venue</strong>: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7tDn5HZsETaZC2mt7" rel="external">Tākina Wellington Convention and Exhibition Centre</a>, Wellington, New Zealand
        </p>
        <p>
          This is one of the few tech conferences in Wellington, where our whole software team (Product, Engineering, Management) can go together.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="{{ '/about' | url }}">EVENT_NAME</a> is all about uplifting, sharing, and showcasing talents in Kiwi software community. <a href="https://youtu.be/w96OLjmvELY?si=ecmkDbgrBmZbDvIW" rel="external">They are behind one of the most physically accessible software events in New Zealand</a> like <a href="https://nztestingconf.nz" rel="external">NZTestingConf</a>. Their mission aligns with our company and my values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, their conferences always focus on practical and real-life experience in the NZ context. Which means lessons will be more applicable to our operations in NZ.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Why this year’s content will be great for our company
        </h3>
        <p>This year's topic focus on different ways we can prepare individuals, teams, organisations, and industry for next year's changes. Some of the unique lessons includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ways to harness diversity within our team</li>
          <li>Creating a resilient tech team</li>
          <li>Making strategic career choices</li>
          <li>Understand how and why management makes pivoting decisions</li>
          <li>How radical transparency works in a real Kiwi software firm</li>
          <li>Practical approach to handling burn out</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While attending EVENT_NAME, I'll also have the opportunity to network with hundreds of peers from all over NZ and learn more about how they are solving similar challenges to ours.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How this will develop my career
        </h3>
        <p>I would love an opportunity to grow in our company. I believe this conference will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow me to mentor and be mentored by others via career building activities during breaks</li>
          <li>Expose me to diverse software and career approaches by experts working in different parts of software lifecycle, at different seniority</li>
          <li>Let me interact with and learn from other software professionals, who cares about growing sustainably together, through career coaching activities</li>
          <li>Give me an opportunity to validate my progress and lessons learnt while working at our company</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>

        <h3>
          Travel &amp; accommodation cost (optional)
        </h3>
        <p>
          In order to attend the conference, I will need to travel to Wellington. To ensure that I’ll be able to absorb as much knowledge and experience as I could, I’d also need accommodation before and after.
        </p>

          <li>$200 return flights</li>
          <li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          I see this as an investment in my professional development and couldn't be more excited to attend. I’d be happy to share lessons, business advantages, and logistics with you and the wider group.
        </p>
