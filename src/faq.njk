      </p>

      <h4>Physical access</h4>
      <p>
        First, we picked this venue due to its unparalleled access to public transport and reasonable wheelchair access.
      </p>

      <h4>Other</h4>
      <p>
        If you require other accommodations, please let us know when you’re purchasing a ticket or email <a href="mailto:registration@nztechrally.nz">registration@nztechrally.nz</a> if you have any questions.

    <div class="text-indent">
      <p>
        No, we do not have the capacity to manage a hybrid experience this year. But we are seriously researching it for our following events.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand not everyone is comfortable with large crowds or can attend in person. We will work hard to slowly make our events more inclusive as we gain more capacity and experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, if you have experience hosting a virtual or hybrid event, we’d love to hear from you. Please get in touch by emailing <a href="mailto:volunteer@nztechrally.nz">volunteer@nztechrally.nz</a>.

          But we cannot guarantee that we can avoid you completely.
        </p>
      <p>
          If you do find yourself clearly identifiable in a photograph on our website, then don't hesitate to get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:info@nztechrally.nz">info@nztechrally.nz</a>. We will make you unidentifiable, or take the photograph down and delete it from our collection.
