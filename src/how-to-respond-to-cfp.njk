       If you’ve never responded to a Call for Proposals (CFP) before, the process may appear to be confusing. This article is intended to show you what we at EVENT_NAME are looking for in our CFPs, and hopefully demystify the process along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        *Note, this advice is specific to our CFP process, and while some of it will be of general use, do note that each conference programme committee will have their own preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s go through the process question by question.

        Should be short, snappy, and encapsulate what the talk is about, and what the tone is. If the audience can see nothing else but your talk title, would they know enough or be enticed to pay to watch your talk?
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s probably easiest to do this part last.
      </p>

      <h3>

        This is the snappy description of your presentation and will appear on our website if successful. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t get into the weeds here. Think of it like a movie trailer; what kind of presentation is it (informative, interactive, etc) what’s the premise of the talk, what’s the central conflict, and how will that get resolved?
      </p>

      <h3>
        Example

        Your team has been told to make your web app accessible in 12 months.

      </p>
      <p> 
        You may have been interested in accessibility before. You suspect that HTML5 will get you close. You’re vaguely aware of tabbing through the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        But surely, there's more to it? What does it really take to make an accessible site?

        Spoiler: It’s a cultural shift

        This is a practical guide on how to become an accessible digital product team.

    <div class="section-label accent-border">
      <h2 class="section-title">Describe what the presentation is about</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text-indent">
      <p>
        This won’t get published but is for us to understand what the talk is really about and how it will be structured. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Please tell us what the presentation is about, what the structure of the presentation is, why you think it is interesting, who is your target audience and what the takeaways for the audience would be.  It is probably easiest to do this part first, and it requires the least wordsmithing. That said, the programme committee are humans too, so this section should still sound enticing!

        If you are shortlisted, you will be invited to a 30min discussion. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>This is not an interview.</strong> This is literally a chance for you to explain your idea again in an informal and relaxed setting. We might offer our thoughts on how it may align to the theme better, or our idea of how we think the programme is shaping up. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Good luck, and have fun with it! Relax and let your personality shine through your submission.
