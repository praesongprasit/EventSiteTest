        <p>We provide inclusive spaces for the NZ software community to celebrate, connect and grow together.</p>
        <p>EVENT_NAME will do this by:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Showcasing NZ ingenuity in software</li>
          <li>Providing opportunities to grow our community’s network and impact</li>
          <li>Creating safe, inclusive, accessible and diverse educational content</li>
          <li>Sharing Kiwi adaptation of good software practices and emerging technologies</li>

      </div>

      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>
          NZ has many events that cater for anyone working in tech, such as Webstock, Tech Week, Code Camp, etc. These events talk about general tech-related topics, ranging from product management to design to code. 
        </p>
        <p>
          NZ also has many events that focus on specific engineering practices or tools: like security, cloud, full-stack, mobile development, JavaScript, robotics, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there isn’t anything that focuses on broad software engineering concerns.
        </p>
        <p> 
          We also noticed that many topics are case studies from overseas and often feature international speakers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is great to look for inspiration outside of the NZ tech bubble, we often forget that there are also great relatable examples in NZ.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to create a place where all engineering roles like QA, front-end, security, and data can get together and share how they address common software engineering problems in NZ.
        </p>
        <p>
          By learning from each other, we can support, strengthen, uplift, and grow software engineering practices in NZ together; something which can’t be done as effectively in practice-based silos.

              We want to see more diverse representation of software engineers in New Zealand.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do this through curation of voices from different abilities, career progression, life stages, sexual orientation, and ethnic groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              We long for welcoming and safe spaces for the community to gather, in an accessible and affordable way.
