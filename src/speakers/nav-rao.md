Nav is currently a lead data engineer at an agri-tech startup in Australia. He works with geospatial data in the hopes of creating a platform where farmers can aggregate and understand the metrics that drive the success of their farms.

He self identifies as a product engineer, with a strong focus on building and maintaining features that directly influence customers both in early stage startups and scale ups. Having been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, Nav is a strong advocate for transparent communication on mental health and neurodiversity both at work and outside of it.

When not actively working, he’s focused on creative writing, practising standup comedy and any other passing interest that’s shiny enough to catch his eye.
