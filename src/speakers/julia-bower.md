Julia is a Senior Software Engineer at Serko with more than a decade of engineering experience. She has worked both in NZ and London for companies ranging from startups to large enterprises such as Avanade, Spark, IAG and ANZ.

She has recently become a co-founder of The Fractional Directory, a Business Directory for CEOs and Founders to search for and access Fractional Leadership Talent in New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. Notably, The Fractional Directory went from idea to launch in 90 days.

Through her experiences in the corporate world, co-founding a startup and becoming a parent, she has found her passion in challenging traditional work norms and working towards carving out a new path for both herself and to help others to achieve balance and satisfaction in their careers and lives.
