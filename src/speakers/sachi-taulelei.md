Sachi Taulelei is a changemaker and disruptor who helps leaders and organisations move beyond good intentions to create workplaces where everyone can thrive. As the founder of Humble, she challenges traditional leadership models, drawing on Pacific wisdom to reimagine what’s possible.

With over 25 years in digital, design thinking, and transformation, Sachi has helped teams and organisations uncover their strengths, build cultures of belonging, and navigate change with intention.

Through her work, she helps people find their voice, own their value, and succeed in spaces that weren’t built with them in mind. Because when people feel a true sense of belonging, they don’t just thrive—they move mountains.
