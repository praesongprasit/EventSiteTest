Edward has had a long and winding career, starting off in cancer immunology research, before moving on to QA and lastly into Product, where he has had the opportunity to lead SRE teams in multiple organisations.

Each part of his journey has shaped the next and grown (somewhat) his expertise. From research, experiments, and statistics, to attempting to learn what “quality” actually is, then onto discovering and growing in areas of resilience engineering, learning from incidents and community creation. All these areas he utilises everyday running the internal observability team at Kiwibank.

Outside of work, he mainly spends time trying to keep up with his two young daughters while still getting to enjoy all the natural beauty Wellington has to offer.
