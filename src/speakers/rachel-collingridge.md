Rachel is a senior engineering leader whoâ€™s all about connecting the dots between happy customers, thriving engineers, and successful businesses. When those three come together, magic happens!

She works with engineering managers and principal engineers, helping them coach and grow delivery teams which perform and scale well, sustainably. She teams up with execs and product folk to make sure they are always focused on delivering value and improving how they work.

Rachel keeps her ear to the ground, spots patterns, and builds communities where people can learn and share. She does all of this with a mix of honesty, empathy, and a good dose of humour. At the heart of Rachel's leadership? Learning, listening, and having fun while shipping great software.

When she's switched off from work, you'll find her on Wellington's hill trails with her dog, spending time with family, or playing some sort of large wind instrument.
