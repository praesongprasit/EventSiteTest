talkTitle: "From developing software to voiding warranties: a journey into hacking"
talkExcerpt: "  
<p> From attending a security conference and having a ‘Huh, I could do that’ moment, all the way through to presenting original Microsoft 0-days at DEFCON (the world’s largest hacking conference), what happens when a developer wants to become a hacker and break things instead of make things?
</p>

<p>This presentation is about my journey from building software for some of NZ’s largest profile startups and organisations, to the moment that I realised that being a hacker wasn’t a million miles away from my software skillset. 
</p>

<p>I want to show QA’s, developers & technologists that cybersecurity and hacking things isn’t an inscrutable field, it’s just another side of what they do day to day.</p>
