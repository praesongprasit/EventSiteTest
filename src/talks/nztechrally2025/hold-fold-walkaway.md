talkTitle: "Hold, fold or walk away: navigating burnout like The Gambler"
talkExcerpt: "  
<p>Next to imposter syndrome, no topic elicits more oohs and ahhs than burnout. However, much of the advice on navigating burnout is generalised to the point of being vacuous.</p>

<p>Nav is changing tact with an alternative style of talk, one that proclaims advice in the style of the Kenny Rogers classic, The Gambler.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll learn when to hold, when to fold and when to walk away from the moments that can burn you.</p>
