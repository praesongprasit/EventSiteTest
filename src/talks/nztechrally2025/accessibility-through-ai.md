talkTitle: "Accessibility through AI?"
talkExcerpt: "  
<p>Did you know 1 in 4 New Zealanders have a disability? That's 1.1 million people! Yet only 3% of kiwi organisations are meeting accessibility standards. Access is a key tenet - can AI be the answer to making our digital assets more accessible? </p>

<p>This talk explores the benefits and pitfalls of AI in achieving accessibility. We'll look at real world cases of how AI can be used to help accessibility initiatives, and areas where we need to be weary. How can we leverage this new technology to increase access? Hint: it's not what you think!</p>
