talkTitle: "Transformation at scale: Tactics and implementation for levelling up our deployment process"
talkExcerpt: " 
<p>Over the past year, I’ve led a program to eliminate manual regression testing and accelerate deployment velocity at scale—over 2,000 engineers. This shift required tackling complex testing workflows, third-party integrations, and cultural change, making developers responsible for tests.</p>

<p>In this session, I’ll share key strategies for securing buy-in, coordinating across teams, and maintaining momentum. Attendees will learn how to drive large-scale change through stakeholder alignment, soft power, and effective program management.</p>
